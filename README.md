# Newtonian Gravity Simulator (Unity)

## Overview

The Newtonian Gravity Simulator is a Unity-based project that provides a visual representation of gravitational interactions between objects. This simulator is compiled for WebGL, making it accessible for online use.

## Features

- **Realistic Gravity Simulation:** Experience a realistic simulation of gravitational forces between objects in a 2D environment.
  
- **WebGL Compatibility:** The simulator is compiled for WebGL, allowing users to access and interact with it directly from their web browsers.

- **Interactive Controls:** Users can Create objects in the simulation, observing how they affect each others gravitational pull's.

## How to Use
